# IBM Data Science Specialization - Coursera

This repository contains the resources and projects developed during the completion of the "IBM Data Science Specialization" on Coursera. This specialization consists of a series of courses offered by IBM in collaboration with Coursera, aimed at providing a comprehensive and practical understanding of data science.

## Overview

The specialization comprises several courses, each addressing different aspects of data science, including:

- Fundamentals of Data Science with Python and SQL
- Tools and Libraries for Data Science
- Data Visualization with Python
- Data Analysis with Python
- Machine Learning with Python
- IBM Data Science Projects

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific course, containing resources, codes, and projects related to that course.
