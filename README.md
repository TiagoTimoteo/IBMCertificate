# IBM Data Science Specialization - Coursera

This repository contains the resources and projects developed during the completion of the "IBM Data Science Specialization" on Coursera. This specialization consists of a series of courses offered by IBM in collaboration with Coursera, aimed at providing a comprehensive and practical understanding of data science.

## Overview

The specialization comprises several courses, each addressing different aspects of data science, including:

- Fundamentals of Data Science with Python and SQL
- Tools and Libraries for Data Science
- Data Visualization with Python
- Data Analysis with Python
- Machine Learning with Python
- IBM Data Science Projects

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific course, containing resources, codes, and projects related to that course.

## Repository Structure

- `Course1_Fundamentals_of_Data_Science`: Resources and projects from Course 1.
- `Course2_Tools_and_Libraries_for_Data_Science`: Resources and projects from Course 2.
- `...` (continue as necessary)

## How to Use

You can explore the different directories to find materials specific to each course. Within each directory, you'll find:

- Jupyter Notebooks: Containing codes and examples of concepts covered in the course.
- Resources: Additional files, datasets, and any other relevant materials.

Feel free to explore, clone, or download this repository for your personal reference. If you're currently taking the specialization or are interested in data science, I hope this repository proves useful to you.
